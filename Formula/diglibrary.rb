# The formula for the personal tap, kept here because this is where it is
# reviewed and versioned; the tap repository is a copy of this one file.
#
# **Why a tap at all, when `pipx install diglibrary` is one line.** Because that
# line is the third of three: somebody has to install Homebrew, then use it to
# get Python, ffmpeg and pipx, then run `pipx ensurepath`, then close the
# Terminal and open it again because their shell has not heard about the new
# path. ffmpeg is the reason Homebrew was needed in the first place — it is not
# a Python package and nothing pip does can bring it.
#
# So the tap is not a second way to install the same thing. It is the route that
# removes the two steps most likely to lose somebody:
#
#     brew tap cankblunt/diglibrary
#     brew install diglibrary
#
# `ffmpeg` arrives as a dependency, the command is on the path when the second
# line returns, and there is no reopened window. `chromaprint` stays out on
# purpose: it is genuinely optional (fingerprinting), and a hundred megabytes
# nobody asked for is not a good first impression.
#
# To update for a release: change `url`, `sha256` and `version`, then
#   brew audit --strict --online Formula/diglibrary.rb
#   brew fetch --build-from-source diglibrary
#   brew install --build-from-source diglibrary
# The resources move only when a dependency does.
